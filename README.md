# Fractals
## Carpet of Sierpinskis
It's a square with a Sierpiski Triangle in each corner and a rotated Carpet of Sierpinskis in the middle!
To use it, just download the zip file, unzip it, go to the folder _**Carpet of Sierpinskis**_, and open _**Carpet of Sierpinskis.html**_. A popup asking for generations will come and if you don't know what it means, just press enter and the best resolution will be chosen automatically. After a while, you'll see a pretty fractal:

## Double Trangle (Tianted Glass)
It looks a bit like tainted glass!
To use it, just download the zip file, unzip it, go to the folder _**Double Triangle**_, and open _**Double Triangle.html**_. A window asking `How many generations?` will pop up and if you don't know what it means, just press enter and the best generation count will be chosen automatically. After loading, you'll see this (or similar):
